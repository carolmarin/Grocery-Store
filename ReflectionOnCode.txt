This application should run and fulfill all the requirements. However, the psycopg2 module won't run on my computer with the error message
"Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\camar\Desktop\CS425\App.py", line 6, in <module>
    import psycopg2
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psycopg2'"

psycopg2 is the connector that allows PostgreSQL and Python to connect.
